    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>In 2000 when I was 10-years-old I started playing Neopets. That website is where my interest in coding began. You could edit your userlookup pages, pet pages, shops, and galleries to look however you wanted with HTML and CSS. Of course there were pre-made layouts but I was picky and always wanted to do my own thing.</p>

    <p>After a few years I moved on to editing my layouts on websites like Xanga, Livejournal, and MySpace. It was something I always loved doing. Now after years of my only coding experince being casually updating my Neopets layout, I wanted to learn more. </p>
