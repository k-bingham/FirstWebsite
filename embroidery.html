    <h1>A Q&A On Embroidery</h1>
    <br><h3>What is this hobby exactly?</h3></article>
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/64c1e3da-0ab1-4415-8e92-aa328a38454d%2FFINN.png?v=1616530782723" alt="mixed media embroidery art of WWE wrestler Finn Balor" height="300" class="floatleft">
    <article class="right">
    <p>Mixed-media hand embroidery is mixing hand embroidery with at least one other element such as <em>paint</em>, <em>beads</em>, or other <em>objects</em>. </p>
  <h3>How does it make you feel?</h3>
    <p>How it makes me feel depends on the nature of the piece I am working on. Usually my <strong>feelings</strong> come <strong>first</strong> and then I create but there are times the <em>opposite</em> is true. I do my best art when I am in a good mood and working on a piece where the subject is close to my heart. When I'm creating while upset, all I can see is what's gone wrong so I tend to stay away at those times.  I do enjoy what I call "mindless paintings" when I'm feeling down though. I just apply bright paint to a canvas and where ever it goes, it stays.</p>
  <h3>What experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?</h3>
    <p>Creating art of my favorite wrestlers and tv characters has given me the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people who also enjoy the same things I do. It's also provided me a way to show my appreciation to those who inspire me in a way they can see and interact with.</p></article>
